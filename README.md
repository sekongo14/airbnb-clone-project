### Feature Breakdown
1. User Management

This feature allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. Users can act as hosts (listing properties) or guests (booking stays). It ensures secure authentication and role-based access throughout the platform.

2. Property Management

Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings. Each property includes details such as title, description, price per night, and location. This feature helps hosts manage their offerings and makes it easy for guests to browse available options.

3. Booking System

The booking system enables guests to reserve properties for specific dates. It checks availability, prevents overlapping reservations, and updates property status automatically. This ensures a smooth and reliable booking experience for users.

4. Review & Rating System

After completing a stay, guests can leave a review and rate the property. These reviews help future guests make informed decisions and provide valuable feedback to hosts to improve their services.

5. Payment Integration

This feature manages payments for bookings, ensuring that transactions are secure and tracked. It supports different payment methods and handles payment statuses such as pending, completed, or failed, giving users confidence when making reservations.

6. Search & Filter

Guests can search for properties based on criteria such as location, price range, or number of guests. Filtering makes it easy to find the perfect stay quickly, improving overall user experience and engagement.

7. Admin Dashboard (optional enhancement)

An admin panel allows administrators to monitor platform activity, manage users, and remove inappropriate listings or reviews. This feature ensures the platform remains safe, organized, and well-maintained.


### API Security üîí 

Securing the backend APIs is a critical part of building a reliable and trustworthy Airbnb Clone. This section outlines the main security measures that will be implemented to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure safe transactions.

1. Authentication

All users must authenticate before accessing protected resources using secure methods such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth2.
Why it‚Äôs important: Authentication ensures that only verified users can access their data or perform sensitive actions, preventing identity theft or account misuse.

2. Authorization

Role-based access control (RBAC) will be implemented to restrict actions based on user roles (e.g., Host, Guest, Admin).
Why it‚Äôs important: It ensures users can only perform actions they are permitted to ‚Äî for example, a guest cannot modify another host‚Äôs property, and an admin has extended privileges for platform management.

3. Data Encryption

Sensitive data such as passwords and payment information will be encrypted both in transit (HTTPS) and at rest (database encryption).
Why it‚Äôs important: Encryption prevents attackers from intercepting or accessing private information, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of user data.

4. Rate Limiting

API rate limiting will be enforced to prevent excessive requests and protect the system from DDoS attacks or brute-force login attempts.
Why it‚Äôs important: This maintains server performance and prevents malicious users from overloading or abusing the API.

5. Input Validation & Sanitization

All user input will be validated and sanitized to prevent SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and other common vulnerabilities.
Why it‚Äôs important: Input validation ensures that only clean, expected data enters the system, keeping the backend and database safe from exploitation.

6. Secure Payment Processing

Payment APIs will integrate with trusted third-party services (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) using tokenized transactions.
Why it‚Äôs important: This ensures that sensitive financial data is never stored on our servers, reducing the risk of data breaches and fraud.

7. Logging and Monitoring

All authentication attempts, transactions, and errors will be logged and monitored for unusual behavior.
Why it‚Äôs important: Continuous monitoring allows quick detection of potential attacks and improves the ability to respond to security incidents in real-time.


‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline
What is CI/CD?

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is a modern development practice that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying applications.

Continuous Integration (CI) ensures that every change pushed to the codebase is automatically tested and verified.

Continuous Deployment (CD) automates the release process, allowing new versions of the application to be deployed quickly and safely.

Why It‚Äôs Important for This Project

Implementing a CI/CD pipeline ensures faster development cycles, higher code quality, and fewer manual errors.
For the Airbnb Clone project, CI/CD will:

Automatically run tests whenever code is committed to detect bugs early.

Build and deploy the backend and frontend efficiently.

Maintain consistent environments between development, staging, and production.

Enable quick delivery of new features and bug fixes with minimal downtime.

In short, CI/CD makes the project more reliable, scalable, and developer-friendly.

Tools That Can Be Used

GitHub Actions: For automating build, test, and deployment workflows directly from the GitHub repository.

Docker: To containerize the application, ensuring consistency across environments.

Docker Compose or Kubernetes: For orchestrating multi-service deployments (e.g., backend, database, frontend).

AWS / Heroku / Render / DigitalOcean: For hosting and deploying the application automatically from the pipeline.

pytest / Jest: For running automated backend and frontend tests during the CI phase.
