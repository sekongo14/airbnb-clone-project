### Feature Breakdown
1. User Management

This feature allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. Users can act as hosts (listing properties) or guests (booking stays). It ensures secure authentication and role-based access throughout the platform.

2. Property Management

Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings. Each property includes details such as title, description, price per night, and location. This feature helps hosts manage their offerings and makes it easy for guests to browse available options.

3. Booking System

The booking system enables guests to reserve properties for specific dates. It checks availability, prevents overlapping reservations, and updates property status automatically. This ensures a smooth and reliable booking experience for users.

4. Review & Rating System

After completing a stay, guests can leave a review and rate the property. These reviews help future guests make informed decisions and provide valuable feedback to hosts to improve their services.
