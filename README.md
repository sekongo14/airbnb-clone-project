## üîí API Security

Securing backend APIs is essential for reliability and trust. Below are the key security measures for this project:

### 1. Authentication
Users must log in securely using **JWT** or **OAuth2**.  
‚û°Ô∏è Ensures only verified users access protected data.

### 2. Authorization
Implements **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**.  
‚û°Ô∏è Prevents unauthorized users from performing restricted actions.

### 3. Data Encryption
Encrypts sensitive data at rest and in transit using **HTTPS** and database encryption.  
‚û°Ô∏è Protects against data theft and ensures confidentiality.

### 4. Rate Limiting
Limits repeated API calls to prevent DDoS or brute-force attacks.  
‚û°Ô∏è Keeps servers stable and secure.

### 5. Input Validation & Sanitization
Validates all user inputs to prevent SQL Injection, XSS, and other attacks.  
‚û°Ô∏è Protects the system from malicious data entry.

### 6. Secure Payment Processing
Uses trusted third-party services like **Stripe** or **PayPal**.  
‚û°Ô∏è Sensitive card data is never stored on our servers.

### 7. Logging and Monitoring
Tracks login attempts, transactions, and suspicious activities.  
‚û°Ô∏è Enables fast detection and response to security threats.

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
A **CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)** pipeline automates building, testing, and deploying applications.  
It ensures that every code change is verified and integrated smoothly into production.

### Why CI/CD is Important
- **Automated Deployment** ‚Üí Reduces manual errors.  
- **Improved Code Quality** ‚Üí Tests run automatically for each change.  
- **Faster Delivery** ‚Üí Enables rapid and reliable feature releases.  
- **Consistency** ‚Üí Ensures identical environments across development, staging, and production.

### Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions** ‚Üí Automates build, test, and deployment workflows.  
- **Docker** ‚Üí Ensures environment consistency.  
- **Docker Compose / Kubernetes** ‚Üí Manages multi-container deployments.  
- **AWS / Heroku / Render / DigitalOcean** ‚Üí For hosting and continuous deployment.  
- **pytest / Jest** ‚Üí For automated testing during CI.
